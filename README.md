# flow_network
A Python implementation of various network flow algorithms. 

The main classes and functions are:  

FlowNw: Representation of flow network using defaultdict.

ek: This function implements the Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a network.  

sshp: This function implements the Shortest Successive Path algorithm for finding the minimum cost flow in a network.  

bf: This function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a directed graph with negative weights.  

bfs: This function implements the Breadth-first search algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, which is also used in function ek.
